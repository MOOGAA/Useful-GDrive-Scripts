# GDrive File Organizer
This organizes files from a parent folder into current month on google drive

## How to Use
1. Copy code into Google Scripts (.gs) (Link to Google Script - https://www.google.com/script/start/)
2. Change line 40 so instead of 'ADD THE PARENT FOLDER ID HERE!!!!!!!' it is your parent folder ID
3. Run

If you want to do other folders simply copy and paste the subReddit1() function and replace the FOLDER_ID with the new parent folder ID
