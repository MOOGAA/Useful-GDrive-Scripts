# GDrive File Organizer
This organizes files from a parent folder into current month on google drive

# How to Use
1. Copy code into Google Scripts (.gs) (Link to Google Script - https://www.google.com/script/start/)
2. Change line 40 so instead of 'ADD THE PARENT FOLDER ID HERE!!!!!!!' it is your parent folder ID
3. Run

# Plans
The only plan I have next for this code is to add a year folder first and then month.
